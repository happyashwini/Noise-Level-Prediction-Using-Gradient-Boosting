**Project: Noise Level Analysis for Aircraft Maintenance Prediction**

- **Objective:**
   - Conduct a comparative analysis of Decision Tree, Random Tree, XG Boost, and Gradient Boosting models to predict aircraft maintenance needs based on noise level data.

- **Data Collection and Processing:**
   - Gathered extensive noise level data from diverse aircraft models during operational phases.
   - Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset to remove outliers and ensure data quality.

- **Feature Selection and Engineering:**
   - Identified relevant features influencing noise levels, including engine specifications, flight conditions, and environmental factors.
   - Engineered additional features to enhance model performance.

- **Threshold Determination:**
   - Established a noise level threshold indicative of the acceptable range for safe and efficient aircraft operation.
   - This threshold serves as a critical reference point for maintenance prediction.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Implemented Decision Tree, Random Tree, XG Boost, and Gradient Boosting models for predictive analysis.
   - Trained models on the preprocessed dataset and fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
